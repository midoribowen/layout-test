# Layout Test - Introduction to Programming Evening Class

##### Layout Test, written for code review in the Summer 2015 Intro to Programming class, 9/18/2015

#### By Midori Bowen

## Description

This is a blog or webpage written from various animals' points-of-view.
Buck's Dog Blog uses the basic css (styles.css), which I wrote, to design the page with a header, navigation bar, and two columns -- one for the main content of the page and one for a sidebar. All images within the main column float to the right. The two columns are made even using the  display: table attribute with divs around each column in the html document and then another div around both columns.
Various links in Buck's Dog Blog also use styles.css.
Musashi's World uses Bootstrap along with styles.css.

## Setup

* Link styles.css within Buck's Dog Blog (index.html).
* Link bootstrap.css within Musashi's World (musashi.html).
* Push all .html, .css, .md, and img files to a remote repository in GitHub.
* Push all files to GitHub Pages.
