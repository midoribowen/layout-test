        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img src="img/musashi.png">
        <p>My name is Musashi. This is my story. I was born on September 27nd, 2010. I lived a hard early life, on the streets of Portland,
          until two humans imprisoned me amongst 15 other cats. After several incidents of violence against
        the other captives, I was transferred to a high-security prison, where I was kept in solitary
      confinement. In MaxOHS there were several escape attempts that ended in me wounding multiple guards and
      a visit to what they called 'Quarantine'.</p>
      <p>After several months of struggle <em>they</em> deemed me dangerous and warned all prospective captors
      against my violence. Two such humans decided that I would be a good choice for a prisoner and they
      'adopted' me.</p>
      <p>My new captors operate what I can only guess is a very minimum security prison. I must have gained fame and therefore a cushy imprisonment. My only companion is a turtle, who is kept in a glass cell. She believes me to be an enemy, however sometimes I watch her in hopes that she will tell me more information about our captors.
